# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
In this project, we explore and analyze data to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.
We will uncover key trends through visualizations and statistical analysis, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers.
