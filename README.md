# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
This project was made to increase skills in data analytics and was helped by Coursera to create the script code.

Summary
In this project, I explore and analyze data to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations, allowing me to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. I will uncover key trends through visualizations and statistical analysis, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers.

Solution
In this case study there is a very significant difference in the sales of retail products sold in several countries. Where there are several countries whose sales levels are very low so action is needed to increase product sales in some of these countries. 

The solution that can be done is to make advertisements to promote the company name and its superior products in digital form (digital marketing) and provide discounts on the price of retail products sold in these countries to increase sales. 

In addition, the company must monitor sales results every month in order to monitor sales statistics in various countries. In monitoring, a dashboard can be created on the Tableau platform, Looker Studio, or Microsoft Excel.

Approach
In the process, I started by inputting data and looking at the data to be processed. Then I did data cleansing and identified the dataset, it was to check whether there was empty data or not in the dataset and to see the type of data. after doing data cleaning, I explored the basic statistics of the unit price data which contains the center of tendency and dispersion. The next step is doing data visualization. at this stage, I visualize data from sales quantity for each country to see the top and bottom 20 who shop at the online market company. Then analyze the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold, and analyze the sales trends overtime in several countries that have significant differences.
